Also included is test.c which runs some basic function testing.

Black Box Tests
------------------------------

Black Box Tests:

1. Ensure that malloc call in start_memory returns correctly
2. Ensure that get_memory does not return a partition that is more than double the required size
3. Ensure that after release_memory, the location released is free and if the buddy of the location is freed, the buddies recombine
4. Ensure that end_memory find any memory that has not been released and frees the memory provided by the original malloc call

------------------------------
White Box Tests
------------------------------

1. Ensure that the partitions are dividing into two equal sizes based on the non header free memory
2. Ensure that all variables inthe buddyNode struct are intialized properly when a new buddy is created.
3. Ensure that buddies recombine
4. Ensure that non-buddies won't recombine
5. Ensure that memory locations are properly spaced and sized
6. Ensure that each buddy is either 'left' or 'right' buddy
7. Ensure that the partition size is correct accounting for the header and the 'size' provided
8. Ensure that buddies are marked as 'used' when they are occupied or divided, and 'not used' when they are empty
9. Ensure that when memory is released, the correct memory parition is marked as 'not used'
10. Ensure that the values are correct for both parition size and free memory in that partition
11. Ensure that the program is aware of the lowest level of buddies there are currently being used (smallest partition sizes)
12. Ensure that when a buddy is marked as 'not used' it checks to see if it's buddy is being used.

Black Box Tests
------------------------------

Black Box Tests:

1. Ensure that grow_memory allocates extra memory to the end of a partition.
2. Ensure that if a partition cannot grow, grow_memory relocates the desired partition
3. Ensure that pregrow_memory adds memory to the front ofthe partition

------------------------------
White Box Tests
------------------------------

May fail in some cases of smaller parititons overwriting bigger parititons

1. Ensure that partitions are not over-written if they are occupied
